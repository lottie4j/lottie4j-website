* Core: can already load many different JSON files
  * But not all yet...
  * To be added to the unit tests and the model needs to be further extended
  * See [FileLoaderTest.java#L38](https://github.com/lottie4j/lottie4j/blob/main/core/src/test/java/com/lottie4j/core/handler/FileLoaderTest.java#L38).
* FXPlayer: very basic visualizer
  * Can read a basic Lottie JSON file and draw the paths
  * See below with [DemoApplication.java](https://github.com/lottie4j/lottie4j/blob/main/fxdemo/src/main/java/com/lottie4j/fxdemo/DemoApplication.java) showing the original Lottie on the left, and the very first JavaFX generated image on the right.
