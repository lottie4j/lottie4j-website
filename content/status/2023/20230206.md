Based on a [LottieFile with an animation](https://github.com/lottie4j/lottie4j/commit/28cefb9c8ba59ef420954c39ae9d8ade838d8e90#diff-166d070cf182766be173a83b3675cb8ab2eaac80eea301d965f9af7c455fd3ac), created with [Flow](https://createwithflow.com), the Bezier object needed to be extended in two different objects: FixedBezier and AnimatedBezier.

* Core
  * Added FixedBezier and AnimatedBezier with BezierDeserializer
  * Extended unit tests
* FXPlayer and FXDemo
  * Loading of initial test file
  * Position, colors, strokes... still to be done
