Hmm, the Lottie data format is harder to understand than I hoped... I already knew it's not a logical nested structure, but actually there is a lot of references to data in other structures inside the JSON.

So, to be honest, I'm in the typical worst point that every project faces...

But on the bright side, we have our first correct color and stroke width output! The right pink border is the same as on the left, so I know where to find some info to be used in the drawing...
